# CRPG Skill System UI

As part of the final stages of my recruiting process for EpicTellers, I was tasked with creating a skill system in Godot that can support active abilities across characters in a turn-based combat environment.

The main goals of the test were to represent combat CRPG abilities using Godot resources, have the concept of a system that can hold & activate abilities for characters (optionally adding parameters to the skills that I deemed necessary) and create a simple UI to represent & interact with everything mentioned previously (similar to a CRPG Hotbar).

Additionally, with the project, I had to deliver a showcase video and a diary explaining my progress for each day (good and bad) with images showing the evolution.
